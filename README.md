### Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* Using Jupyter notebook from Anaconda is recommended. You may use other data visualization tools like Tableau for reference. The libraries required with appropriate versions can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Sankalp22863/MachineLearningWebApp/blob/master/requirements.txt).

### Repository structure



### Project Motivation
This is a plug and play app used for visual analysis of the data used in the youtube universe comments.


### Models Availabe
* Logistic regression:
* Support Vector Machine:
* Support Vector Machine with Linear Kernel:
* Support Vector Machine using RBF Kernel:
* Support Vector Machine using Polynomial Kernel:
* Decision Tree Classifier:
* K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier:
* Extra Tree Classifier:
* Random Forest Classifier:

### Instructions To Run
First install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now to run the code on streamlit
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Results
The interactive web app is hosted on Streamlit and can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/sankalp22863/mlmodelsgui/main/MLModelsGUI/main.py)
